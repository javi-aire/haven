Haven Agency Phase 2 Exercise (Javier Williams)
---
## description
##### Requested mock as a webpage in this repo
###### I chose to work in [ink.sapo](http://ink.sapo.pt) because of its simple and intuitive responsiveness, as well as the verbosity within its naming conventions. You'll see that most of the media queries regarding the layout reside in the index.html file. Anything else will be in the .css file once it's built.

## installation
1. Clone the repo then run in your CLI
2.
  > npm install
3.
  > gulp

Browser-sync will inform you of the port, and you should be all set!

Hope to hear from y'all soon.
